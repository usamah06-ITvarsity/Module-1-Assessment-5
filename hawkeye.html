        <p>The man who would become known as Hawkeye was born Clint Barton. Orphaned at an early age, he joined the circus and apprenticed himself to the Swordsman, a performer who specialized in tricks with blades. After he discovered the Swordsman stealing from the circus, the two fought, and Barton was left for dead.
            In the comics, Hawkeye has gained a reputation for being able to "turn any object into a weapon", and has been using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks, and other debris to great effect against his enemies. Howkeye is also known to use a "sky-cycle" as his mode of transport.
