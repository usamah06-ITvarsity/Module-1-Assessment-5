        <p>After Thor went off to save Loki from Thanos he was almost killed and sent off<br> to wander off in space where the Guardians of the Galaxy picked him up and helped<br> him. Thor then went to the sacred place where mjolnir was made, to forge a new and<br> improved hammer, this is where he put all his strength to work, the hammer was<br> completre but they did not find a handle for it and Thor was about to die if he did<br> not hold the hammer. So Groot raised the hammer and wrapped his arm around it<br> with his tree like arms and then cut his arm off using it as a handle for Thors hammer </p>
        <br>
        <p>The new hammer is called: <h4>stormbreaker</h4></p>
